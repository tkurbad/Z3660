# BOOT FILES
In this directory you can find the files BOOT.bin, z3660_scsi.rom and z3660cfg.txt, and some folders.
All this content will go into the root of your Z-Turn microSD (must have MBR, first partition FAT32 formatted, so we are limited to 4GB files. Second partition could be exFAT formatted, but it doesn't work right now...).

 * <b>BOOT.bin</b> contains the FPGA bitstream and ARMs standalone programs.

 * <b>z3660_scsi.rom</b> contains the bootrom of SD SCSI emulation, so you need it only if you are going to boot from hdf files.

 * <b>z3660cfg.txt</b> contains some configuration of the Z3660. It should be very self explanatory.
In z3660cfg.txt, you can comment out a line with a `#` on the first character of a line. If you use multiple lines with the same configuration, the last one config is what will be finally selected.

 * <b>Folders</b>: each folder has a readme...

# A note on the type of microSD card to use in the Z-Turn
I have received a microSD with every Z-turn I have bought, but they are HC and yes, they are really slow!!! Please use XC microSDs.
