# Z3660 CPLD

To build CPLD XC95144XL, I use ISE 13.1. Also I use IMPACT to flash the device, with a platform cable from Xilinx (use "JTAG" labeled connector of the PCB).
<br>Optionally, there are people flashing these CPLDs using a Raspberry Pi... google for it if you need it.
<br>The "z3660.jed" file is what you flash into the CPLD.

## NOTE WIP
This is a WIP version that is compatible with Z3 DMA devices. However, it has problems when starting up. It may take a few resets to get it to boot. As it stated here, this firmware is under construction. WIP.
